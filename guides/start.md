# [Proca - Progressive Campaigning](https://proca.app)

**Installation & Development Setup Guide**

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

To develop and run the Proca server, you’ll need:

- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)**
- **[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)**
- **[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)**
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**

> We **recommend using `asdf`** to install Erlang and Elixir. Other installation methods may lead to version conflicts you'll need to resolve manually.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone your fork of the repo**.

2. Run the following setup commands:

```bash
sudo apt install automake libssl-dev autoconf libncurses5-dev
asdf plugin add erlang
asdf plugin add elixir
asdf install
mix local.rebar
mix local.hex
```

## 🧪 Development Setup

1. Ensure **PostgreSQL** and **RabbitMQ** are installed and running.

2. Set the environment variables:

   ```bash
   export MIX_ENV=dev
   ```

   and

   `export ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email@example.com`

3. Run the configuration script:

   ```bash
   ./utils/configure-development-env.sh
   ```

   This script:

   - Sets up PostgreSQL
   - Installs Erlang, Elixir, Phoenix and RabbitMQ dependencies
   - Runs `npm install` inside the `assets/` directory

> You'll be prompted for `sudo` during parts that configure PostgreSQL.

> You'll be prompted for setting the ADMIN_EMAIL variable if you failed on reading this manual.
> The script will print out your login and password:

    #####
    #####   Created Admin user your_admin_email@example.com  #####
    #####   Password: VERY_RANDOM_PASSWORD
    #####

## Optional environment variables

For development purposes, you can use the following environment variables to customize server behavior:

- `ENABLE_TELEMETRY`
  If set to `true`, the server will expose Prometheus metrics on port `9568`.
  **Disabled by default in development.**

- `START_DAEMON_SERVERS`
  If set to `true`, the server will start background processes.
  Disable this to speed up development server startup (e.g., if you're not working on MTT).
  **Enabled by default**, disable with:
  ```bash
  export START_DAEMON_SERVERS=false
  ```
